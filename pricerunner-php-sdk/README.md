# Pricerunner import PHP SDK

This SDK is made to make it easier for your system to import your products into Pricerunner.
For many OpenSource systems we've built plugins to make it even easier for you. Those plugins make use of this SDK.

This SDK can be used by you if you aren't using a OpenSource system or if we haven't built a plugin for your system yet.


## Usage
_Documentation will be added soon._
